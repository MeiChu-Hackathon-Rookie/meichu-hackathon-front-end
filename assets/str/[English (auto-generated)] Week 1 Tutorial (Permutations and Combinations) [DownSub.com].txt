hello

and can you hear me

okay excellent sorry for the delay so

there was some

connection problem

okay

so if you so let me double check okay so

welcome all for coming

okay let me double check so if you can

hear me clearly could you please give me

some response could you please type a

one

okay thanks very much okay

so

so so for today so we will talk about

something that is related to the

content of

our first week's and lectures

thank you very much okay

so we have tried to receive your

questions during the weekend but perhaps

uh it's just the beginning of the

semester so you don't have a lot of

questions so i've prepared something for

you so it should be a very quick uh

tutorial today

and then if you have any questions there

please don't hesitate to ask me

okay so one key thing that we have

talked about

in the last class is something called

combinatorial arguments

so combinatorial arguments are something

that is

is a way of proving identities

so

i checked the wikipedia so mainly there

are two different categories of

combinatorial arguments

so the first one is called double

counting

so the double counting technique is we

try to count

the same quantity a value which talks

about the number of ways of doing things

we count it using two different methods

so in that case we will have two views

of the same quantity so that we can we

can get our desired result

and the other type of combinatorial

argument is the so-called bijective

proof

and for this one it is used to show that

two sets have the same number of items

so by

finding a one-to-one correspondence

between the items of the two sets we

will see that the two sets will have the

same number of items but this is not the

focus of today so we will talk about

double counting

and then we will look at a couple of

examples today

so this is

the easiest example probably

so in this example we want to show that

n choose k the value of n choose k

is always the same as the value of n

choose n minus k

now remember when we are doing

combinatorial arguments we do not have

any access to the

exact

formula for n choose k so we don't know

entries k is equal to something like

n factorial divided by k factorial and n

minus k factorial we don't know this

we just want to argue

the meaning from the physical meaning of

each of the terms

and then we want to establish the

equivalence of the both sides okay

so first of all n choose k is what n

choose k is the number of ways of

selecting k items from a total of n

items

so

so

by viewing of selection of k items to

keep

so it must be the same as

we are so when we try to keep k items so

it must mean that we are throwing away n

minus k items

so each time we keep a particular

set of k items we are actually throwing

the complements

n minus k items there

so the number of ways of selection of k

items must be done the same as the

number of ways of

discarding n minus k items so that's why

we have n choose k

is equal to n choose n minus k so this

is quite easy right

now let's take a look of this one

oh this is something that i just come up

now so so please help me to double check

whether this is correct

so here we are saying that n plus one

the permutation the number of

permutations of

uh p n plus one r

so this is like we have n plus one

objects to select

and then we want to select all of them

and then make an arrangement so the

number of ways of doing so

is always the same as

p n r plus r times

p n r minus 1.

so how do we interpret this result

so first of all we will see that on the

left hand side there is n plus one r and

on the right hand side there is n r

right

so m plus one r and n r they are

different by having one extra

objects here that we can select

so let's call it a special object

okay

so the number of ways of getting a

permutation with the special objects

that we can use

so we can classify this into two

different types

one is

we are going to use we are going to use

the special object

and then the other type is we are not

going to use the special object

okay so here n plus 1 means that we have

n original object plus one new object

that we can use okay

so

so the number of ways of not using the

special object must be p and r right

because we take that away we will not

consider it

so the number of ways of doing selection

of our objects from the old objects and

making an arrangement must be

p and r

okay for the other way

the other way is

so we must include the special objects

so by including the special object so we

will first decide

in which location will the special

objects be placed

because in the end

it is an r permutation there are

positions that these special objects can

be placed

so there are choices that we can make to

place a special object

and then for the remaining r minus 1

positions

we will need to fill in

r minus 1 objects from the old objects

so the number of ways of doing so is p n

r minus 1.

now notice that

again in the previous argument that we

have just made

we are not

looking at any formula for p and r

we are just arguing all the things based

on the definition of the term p and r

and then here we are using rule of

products

and the rule of thumb these basic rules

to help us to understand why this

equality must be correct

okay so let's take a look of another

example so so go home

so

if if you want to check your

understanding go home and cover all the

voices of this video and let's see if

you can

come up with the combinatorial ex proof

by yourself

now the next one is called the hockey

stick identity

so it is

saying that

ah

there was something wrong here i'm sorry

so

let me see so

so

sorry there is a mistake here

so it must be something like

this is

n minus 1

sorry

so every time here is n minus one okay

sorry

so let me go back again

so it says that

c n plus one

m m plus one object

choosing m object

must be the same as the summation of the

following terms

the first one is n choose n minus 1

and then the next one is n minus 1

choose n minus 1

and then the next one is n minus 2

choose n minus 1 and so on and so forth

we add up the things

until what until n minus 1 n minus 1.

so why is it so first of all before we

understand why this is correct so let's

understand why we call this a hockey

stick identity

so basically

this is the pascal triangle

that includes all the combinatorial

terms so one and one one and then one

two one and then one three three one one

four six one one and so and so forth

so the hockey stick identity says that

if you want to get the term

this term let's say a particular term

here let's say this is 10 times here the

term 10 here

so we can go

leftward

and one entry to the previous row

and then add up all these along the way

all these along the way so 1 plus 3 plus

6 will be equal to 10.

so let's look at this 10 again this 10

is equal to what this 10 is equal to 4

plus 3 plus 2 plus 1.

so how about this 5 this 5 is 0 to 1

plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1. how about

this 4 this 4 is equal to 3 plus 1.

so

so if we look at the terms that we are

considering it looks like the hockey

stick that we play in hockey

yeah the hockey stick here so that's why

we call it a hockey stick identity

so why is this correct

so again

here we can come up with a story okay

so there are n plus one items here that

we can select so let's label all the

items by one two three four five up to n

plus one

and then we want to select m of them in

total so how many ways are there

now the first term

is the case that we will never select

one so the the the item one is never

selected

i'm sorry so the item one must be

selected sorry this is the item one must

be selected

so the item

one must be selected the number of ways

that we can do so is

because one is already selected so we

will need to find out n minus one items

from the remaining n items to make a

total number of m items so we get this

term n and the n minus one

so this term here means

one is always selected

so for the remaining case

we will need to consider the remaining

case we will we can never select one

because whenever one is selected it is

already counted here

so this term is what this time is

one is not selected but two is selected

so in that case if one is not deleted

but two is selected then what does that

mean

so it means that we will need to find

out n minus one items from the remaining

n minus one items to make a collection

of m items

so this talks about the second term

talks about one not selected but two

selected

and then this is the third term the

third term consider the case that one

and two are both

not selected but we need to select three

so in that case we have this one

and and so on and so forth so lastly

this one

it means that

we will have one two three four five six

seven eight up to n minus one

they are let me see

they are

so so basically so this is this is the

case that a couple of items is not

selected and then and then and then what

what must be selected and so and so

forth so it means that the first

n minus m plus one items are not

selected

so that means that we have only a minus

and the end

i think you you understand what i mean

so so each of the term here corresponds

to

one more item cannot be selected so in

the end we have no choice so for the

remaining we have just a minus one items

left and so we need to select all of

them so this n minus 1 choose n minus 1.

okay so don't worry if you don't

understand what i'm talking about so far

so

most important thing here is

you can

go back home and then

do this by yourself

and then convince yourself that which

what each term

means okay so also what i'm given here

is just one example so you can have your

own story the the way of double counting

proof is

to make a story of what is the quantity

on the left-hand side and make a story

of what is the quantity on the

right-hand side and then we want to show

that these two uh

t these two different stories are doing

the same thing accounting the same

identities so that's why they are equal

so you can make your own story

okay so how about this

one okay so this one is n times n minus

1 choose r is always the same as

r plus 1 times

n choose r plus 1.

so here

so how do we interpret the things here

so here

let's

so it may be a little bit complicated

but let's try to figure out what could

the potential meaning of the left-hand

side

so the left-hand side looks like what

looks like okay so there's n here and

then you multiply something that just

have n minus 1 to choose

so probably we may think of this as

let's say there are n people

in a in a in a class

and then we want to select one of them

as the representative

and after that

we want to select

and extra our people to be the to be the

committee member of of the class society

something like this

so all together that

so we need to select one people as the

representative let's say the chairman of

the class society

and then

are extra members for the class society

so there are n ways of selection of the

chairman out of n people

and then from the remaining n minus 1

people we need to pick out

so this is one way to form a class

society one chairman and then our other

members

now

we can also form a class society using a

different way

but then this is exactly doing the same

thing so what we are going to do here is

we first select all the members

including the chairman for the class

society and after that we pick the

chairman from these members

so how many ways of doing so

so that n choose our plus one ways to

select the chairman together with the

our members in the class society so

these are

forming the members of the class society

first

and then after that we have our plus one

people

and then we need to select the chairman

from from them so there are plus one

ways of doing so so this time we will

see that

the right hand side quantity is the

number of ways that we can form a class

society and the left-hand side is also

the number of ways of that we can form a

class society so they must be equal so

that's why they are equal again there is

no formula involved we are just arguing

things based on the rule of product here

rule of product here that's it

and now finally this is what i want to

introduce to you today so

so this is perhaps the most complicated

example

that we have

so this is actually a selected question

from

from our

exam

in 2019

so here we have a very complicated

summation thing

and then i didn't tell you

what this should be so you are not

proving this is

equal to what but instead

see if we can interpret

what is the summation sign here

so after doing the

the understanding of this we may be able

to find

an easy understanding of what this sum

could be

okay so this is the summation of let's

take a look okay so first of all this

time

bracket and i here simply means n choose

i so this is another shorthand notation

for c and i so n choose i

and then m minus i choose j

so what does that mean so first of all

let's take a look of this one so

forget about the summation let's

understand what this compound

this product means so it looks like the

n people that i want to pick i of them

and then from the remaining a minus i

people i want to pick j of them

okay so so here basically

we are

looking at something like we are trying

to

we are trying to

to

make the members the n members of people

into three different groups

so i of them

in the first group n choose i i of them

in the first group

right

and then

from the n minus i of them i choose j so

j of them in the second group

and finally n minus i minus j of them

in the third group

okay

now here for j is equal to 1 up to n

minus i minus 1 it means that

i'm selecting

the case that

j has to be at least one

and then j can be at most n minus i

minus one

so it means what it means that

the second group

and the third group cannot be

empty it must have some people inside

is that okay

now for here n minus n choose i here

when i ranges from 1 to n minus 2 it

simply means that the first group has at

least one people

is that okay n choose i one people

and up to n minus two people so that we

can have two people left for the second

group and the third group

so all together what does that mean

if you look at this summation sign

we sum up all the different cases

we are trying to

what we are trying to

to what to divide the group of n people

into three groups

okay

such that

each group is not empty

so how many ways of doing so

so any idea

so first of all if there are

no restrictions at all

the number of ways to divide n people

into three different groups

will be 3 to the power n

right

it is because

each particular person can be in group

one group two or group three

so

by rule of product so the first one has

three choice the second one has three

choice and so on and so forth so all

together they are three to the power and

different ways of

dividing the people into three groups

but then we want to avoid

people

so we want to avoid the case that

the first group is empty we want to

avoid the case that the second group is

empty and then we want to avoid the case

that the third group is empty so in that

case we need to do a little bit of

of what of corrections so 3 to the power

n is a little bit more than what we are

counting

so perhaps we have not done this before

but then we can

do something like the principle of

inclusion and exclusion that

i guess you have already studied in your

discrete math class

so by using the principle of inclusion

and exclusion

so the answer should not be just 3 to

the power n

it should be something like 3 to the

power n minus the cases where

one of the group is empty and then plus

the case where two of the groups is

are empty

and then minus the case where three of

the groups are all empty

so

so in that case this is my guess so you

can you can

double check whether this is correct at

home

so this is my solution okay so

let me write this

so this is my solution

my solution will be this one

is equal to

3 to the power n

minus the case that

exactly not exactly at least one of the

group is empty so let's say group 0 is

empty so if group 0 is empty so the the

the

sorry group 1 so let's say we call the

groups group 1 group 2 and group 3.

group 1 is empty so how many ways are

there there are two to the power m is

and then group 2 is empty they're 2 to

the power n ways root 3 is empty they're

2 to the power n base

but then we have

over deducted so we need to add back the

case where

group 1 is group 1 and group 2 is empty

so there are 1 to the power n

plus 1 to the power n

plus 1 to the power n something like

this so in the end this should be

something like so after simplification

this should be 3 to the power n ah maybe

let's see if i can use

a

how can i make it into

let me see format

one yeah i don't know how to how to

change it to the

superscript

there should be a symbol here let me see

let me see

and like this okay three to the power n

it should be something like this

minus 3

times

2 to the power n

and then finally

plus three

so

so this is what i would guess so

perhaps you can double check whether

this is correct or

so this is what i would guess

but to

yeah

but the way that we get this it is

because we have do the simplification to

do the understanding of what this term

could mean and because of this we can

have a good interpretation so that we

can use our existing knowledge to get

the answer

yeah i hope you like this so

combinatorial proof is very useful

because it avoids a lot of

difficult and computation so if you want

so

later we will have formulas for n choose

i n minus 1 minus i choose j something

like this but this is complicated if you

want to simplify them

not to mention that we have a lot of

summations here that we need to handle

but on the other hand if we have a way

to do this interpretation then

everything could be made easy

okay so i think that's all for what i

want to show today yeah because this is

the first week

but i want to mention one thing okay

so we are going to

assume that you will study the materials

of ocw recording and also the lecture

notes at your own pace by yourself so

roughly speaking

we will have three hour lecture normally

in a in a class so that's what we are

expecting you to to review

three hours of ocw recording every week

so on thursday

we will talk about a quick class summary

of the three hour lectures that you have

seen

and then on tuesday like this we will

answer any potential questions that you

want to ask us

or we will prepare something that is

interesting for you so tuesday class

normally will be very short

and that thursday class normally will be

very

quick okay but i hope if you find any

difficulties in the studying yeah please

let us know okay so meanwhile if you

have

any questions could you please

and

stand to the discussion board

here the chat room here

if not then yeah let's meet on thursday

and happy moon festival today

so because i don't see any questions so

let's end the class now okay thanks a

lot for coming okay and then and then

see you on thursday

okay
