1
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,880
hello

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,400
and can you hear me

3
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,359
okay excellent sorry for the delay so

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,720
there was some

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,320
connection problem

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,560
okay

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,320
so if you so let me double check okay so

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,440
welcome all for coming

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,079
okay let me double check so if you can

10
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,399
hear me clearly could you please give me

11
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,920
some response could you please type a

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,920
one

13
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,480
okay thanks very much okay

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,600
so

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,000
so so for today so we will talk about

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,479
something that is related to the

17
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,760
content of

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,040
our first week's and lectures

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,360
thank you very much okay

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,680
so we have tried to receive your

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,159
questions during the weekend but perhaps

22
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,759
uh it's just the beginning of the

23
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,439
semester so you don't have a lot of

24
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,320
questions so i've prepared something for

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,880
you so it should be a very quick uh

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,560
tutorial today

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,240
and then if you have any questions there

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,600
please don't hesitate to ask me

29
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,680
okay so one key thing that we have

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,880
talked about

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,360
in the last class is something called

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,600
combinatorial arguments

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,680
so combinatorial arguments are something

34
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,200
that is

35
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,799
is a way of proving identities

36
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,920
so

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,560
i checked the wikipedia so mainly there

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,399
are two different categories of

39
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,320
combinatorial arguments

40
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,159
so the first one is called double

41
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,840
counting

42
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,159
so the double counting technique is we

43
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,920
try to count

44
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,719
the same quantity a value which talks

45
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,038
about the number of ways of doing things

46
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,200
we count it using two different methods

47
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,760
so in that case we will have two views

48
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,160
of the same quantity so that we can we

49
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,959
can get our desired result

50
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,040
and the other type of combinatorial

51
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,920
argument is the so-called bijective

52
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,800
proof

53
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,760
and for this one it is used to show that

54
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,640
two sets have the same number of items

55
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,680
so by

56
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,160
finding a one-to-one correspondence

57
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
between the items of the two sets we

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,599
will see that the two sets will have the

59
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,760
same number of items but this is not the

60
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,519
focus of today so we will talk about

61
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,360
double counting

62
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,280
and then we will look at a couple of

63
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,239
examples today

64
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,599
so this is

65
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,720
the easiest example probably

66
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,239
so in this example we want to show that

67
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,599
n choose k the value of n choose k

68
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,159
is always the same as the value of n

69
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,200
choose n minus k

70
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,560
now remember when we are doing

71
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,360
combinatorial arguments we do not have

72
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,680
any access to the

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,280
exact

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,040
formula for n choose k so we don't know

75
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,200
entries k is equal to something like

76
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,840
n factorial divided by k factorial and n

77
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,879
minus k factorial we don't know this

78
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,959
we just want to argue

79
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,599
the meaning from the physical meaning of

80
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,280
each of the terms

81
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,120
and then we want to establish the

82
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,400
equivalence of the both sides okay

83
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,640
so first of all n choose k is what n

84
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,799
choose k is the number of ways of

85
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,680
selecting k items from a total of n

86
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,760
items

87
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,879
so

88
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,599
so

89
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,480
by viewing of selection of k items to

90
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,519
keep

91
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,519
so it must be the same as

92
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,720
we are so when we try to keep k items so

93
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,959
it must mean that we are throwing away n

94
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,040
minus k items

95
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,159
so each time we keep a particular

96
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,959
set of k items we are actually throwing

97
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,319
the complements

98
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,480
n minus k items there

99
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,200
so the number of ways of selection of k

100
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,840
items must be done the same as the

101
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,760
number of ways of

102
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,399
discarding n minus k items so that's why

103
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,560
we have n choose k

104
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,040
is equal to n choose n minus k so this

105
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,680
is quite easy right

106
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,840
now let's take a look of this one

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,040
oh this is something that i just come up

108
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,600
now so so please help me to double check

109
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,320
whether this is correct

110
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,199
so here we are saying that n plus one

111
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,560
the permutation the number of

112
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,720
permutations of

113
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,120
uh p n plus one r

114
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,680
so this is like we have n plus one

115
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,440
objects to select

116
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,759
and then we want to select all of them

117
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,440
and then make an arrangement so the

118
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,639
number of ways of doing so

119
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,039
is always the same as

120
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,240
p n r plus r times

121
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,000
p n r minus 1.

122
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,840
so how do we interpret this result

123
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,680
so first of all we will see that on the

124
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,000
left hand side there is n plus one r and

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,759
on the right hand side there is n r

126
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,800
right

127
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,960
so m plus one r and n r they are

128
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,320
different by having one extra

129
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,639
objects here that we can select

130
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,280
so let's call it a special object

131
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,560
okay

132
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,720
so the number of ways of getting a

133
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,199
permutation with the special objects

134
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,360
that we can use

135
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,600
so we can classify this into two

136
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
different types

137
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,560
one is

138
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,360
we are going to use we are going to use

139
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
the special object

140
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,360
and then the other type is we are not

141
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,840
going to use the special object

142
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,080
okay so here n plus 1 means that we have

143
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,720
n original object plus one new object

144
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,000
that we can use okay

145
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,039
so

146
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,919
so the number of ways of not using the

147
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,400
special object must be p and r right

148
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,240
because we take that away we will not

149
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,440
consider it

150
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,840
so the number of ways of doing selection

151
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,919
of our objects from the old objects and

152
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,319
making an arrangement must be

153
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,120
p and r

154
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,120
okay for the other way

155
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
the other way is

156
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,360
so we must include the special objects

157
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,160
so by including the special object so we

158
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,479
will first decide

159
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,639
in which location will the special

160
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,319
objects be placed

161
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,080
because in the end

162
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,680
it is an r permutation there are

163
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,919
positions that these special objects can

164
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:46,880
be placed

165
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,199
so there are choices that we can make to

166
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,599
place a special object

167
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,080
and then for the remaining r minus 1

168
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,440
positions

169
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,080
we will need to fill in

170
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,479
r minus 1 objects from the old objects

171
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,199
so the number of ways of doing so is p n

172
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,960
r minus 1.

173
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,639
now notice that

174
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,440
again in the previous argument that we

175
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,039
have just made

176
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,400
we are not

177
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,599
looking at any formula for p and r

178
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,160
we are just arguing all the things based

179
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,520
on the definition of the term p and r

180
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
and then here we are using rule of

181
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,440
products

182
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,400
and the rule of thumb these basic rules

183
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,199
to help us to understand why this

184
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,800
equality must be correct

185
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,560
okay so let's take a look of another

186
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,360
example so so go home

187
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,400
so

188
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,680
if if you want to check your

189
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,800
understanding go home and cover all the

190
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,440
voices of this video and let's see if

191
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,960
you can

192
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,680
come up with the combinatorial ex proof

193
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,319
by yourself

194
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,560
now the next one is called the hockey

195
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,840
stick identity

196
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,120
so it is

197
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,680
saying that

198
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,720
ah

199
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,639
there was something wrong here i'm sorry

200
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,680
so

201
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,840
let me see so

202
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,479
so

203
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,280
sorry there is a mistake here

204
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,479
so it must be something like

205
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,840
this is

206
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,639
n minus 1

207
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,120
sorry

208
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,960
so every time here is n minus one okay

209
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,000
sorry

210
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,120
so let me go back again

211
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,120
so it says that

212
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,880
c n plus one

213
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,200
m m plus one object

214
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
choosing m object

215
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,839
must be the same as the summation of the

216
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,679
following terms

217
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,880
the first one is n choose n minus 1

218
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,800
and then the next one is n minus 1

219
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,560
choose n minus 1

220
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,560
and then the next one is n minus 2

221
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,279
choose n minus 1 and so on and so forth

222
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,120
we add up the things

223
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,160
until what until n minus 1 n minus 1.

224
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,120
so why is it so first of all before we

225
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,200
understand why this is correct so let's

226
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,959
understand why we call this a hockey

227
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,720
stick identity

228
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,560
so basically

229
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,120
this is the pascal triangle

230
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,200
that includes all the combinatorial

231
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,360
terms so one and one one and then one

232
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,279
two one and then one three three one one

233
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,680
four six one one and so and so forth

234
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,920
so the hockey stick identity says that

235
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,640
if you want to get the term

236
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,240
this term let's say a particular term

237
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,399
here let's say this is 10 times here the

238
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,080
term 10 here

239
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,360
so we can go

240
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,839
leftward

241
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,160
and one entry to the previous row

242
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,640
and then add up all these along the way

243
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,680
all these along the way so 1 plus 3 plus

244
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
6 will be equal to 10.

245
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,760
so let's look at this 10 again this 10

246
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,839
is equal to what this 10 is equal to 4

247
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,560
plus 3 plus 2 plus 1.

248
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,279
so how about this 5 this 5 is 0 to 1

249
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,839
plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1. how about

250
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,120
this 4 this 4 is equal to 3 plus 1.

251
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,079
so

252
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,760
so if we look at the terms that we are

253
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,760
considering it looks like the hockey

254
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,200
stick that we play in hockey

255
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,360
yeah the hockey stick here so that's why

256
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,760
we call it a hockey stick identity

257
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,360
so why is this correct

258
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,839
so again

259
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,279
here we can come up with a story okay

260
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,920
so there are n plus one items here that

261
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,079
we can select so let's label all the

262
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,800
items by one two three four five up to n

263
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,560
plus one

264
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,560
and then we want to select m of them in

265
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,800
total so how many ways are there

266
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,560
now the first term

267
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,279
is the case that we will never select

268
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,800
one so the the the item one is never

269
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,040
selected

270
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,279
i'm sorry so the item one must be

271
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,279
selected sorry this is the item one must

272
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,600
be selected

273
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,480
so the item

274
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,640
one must be selected the number of ways

275
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,640
that we can do so is

276
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,959
because one is already selected so we

277
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,880
will need to find out n minus one items

278
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,279
from the remaining n items to make a

279
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,519
total number of m items so we get this

280
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,000
term n and the n minus one

281
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,399
so this term here means

282
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,040
one is always selected

283
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,959
so for the remaining case

284
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,040
we will need to consider the remaining

285
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,959
case we will we can never select one

286
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,720
because whenever one is selected it is

287
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,560
already counted here

288
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,200
so this term is what this time is

289
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,440
one is not selected but two is selected

290
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,320
so in that case if one is not deleted

291
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,079
but two is selected then what does that

292
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,040
mean

293
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,600
so it means that we will need to find

294
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,160
out n minus one items from the remaining

295
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,240
n minus one items to make a collection

296
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,760
of m items

297
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,680
so this talks about the second term

298
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,000
talks about one not selected but two

299
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,680
selected

300
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,440
and then this is the third term the

301
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,680
third term consider the case that one

302
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,440
and two are both

303
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,560
not selected but we need to select three

304
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,279
so in that case we have this one

305
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,399
and and so on and so forth so lastly

306
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,440
this one

307
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,760
it means that

308
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,000
we will have one two three four five six

309
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,680
seven eight up to n minus one

310
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,320
they are let me see

311
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,959
they are

312
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,760
so so basically so this is this is the

313
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,519
case that a couple of items is not

314
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,000
selected and then and then and then what

315
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,360
what must be selected and so and so

316
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,240
forth so it means that the first

317
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,560
n minus m plus one items are not

318
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,800
selected

319
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,279
so that means that we have only a minus

320
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,480
and the end

321
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,079
i think you you understand what i mean

322
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,320
so so each of the term here corresponds

323
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,040
to

324
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,839
one more item cannot be selected so in

325
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,800
the end we have no choice so for the

326
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,880
remaining we have just a minus one items

327
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,760
left and so we need to select all of

328
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,560
them so this n minus 1 choose n minus 1.

329
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,399
okay so don't worry if you don't

330
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,399
understand what i'm talking about so far

331
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,360
so

332
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,519
most important thing here is

333
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,720
you can

334
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,200
go back home and then

335
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,959
do this by yourself

336
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,360
and then convince yourself that which

337
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,200
what each term

338
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,560
means okay so also what i'm given here

339
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,800
is just one example so you can have your

340
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,800
own story the the way of double counting

341
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,079
proof is

342
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,959
to make a story of what is the quantity

343
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,199
on the left-hand side and make a story

344
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,560
of what is the quantity on the

345
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,480
right-hand side and then we want to show

346
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,360
that these two uh

347
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,440
t these two different stories are doing

348
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,199
the same thing accounting the same

349
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,880
identities so that's why they are equal

350
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,000
so you can make your own story

351
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,839
okay so how about this

352
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,959
one okay so this one is n times n minus

353
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,000
1 choose r is always the same as

354
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
r plus 1 times

355
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,440
n choose r plus 1.

356
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,839
so here

357
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,320
so how do we interpret the things here

358
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,320
so here

359
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,279
let's

360
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,680
so it may be a little bit complicated

361
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,839
but let's try to figure out what could

362
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,680
the potential meaning of the left-hand

363
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,920
side

364
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,920
so the left-hand side looks like what

365
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
looks like okay so there's n here and

366
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,680
then you multiply something that just

367
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,079
have n minus 1 to choose

368
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,040
so probably we may think of this as

369
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,199
let's say there are n people

370
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,000
in a in a in a class

371
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,720
and then we want to select one of them

372
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,279
as the representative

373
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,040
and after that

374
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,880
we want to select

375
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,560
and extra our people to be the to be the

376
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,440
committee member of of the class society

377
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,800
something like this

378
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,639
so all together that

379
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,800
so we need to select one people as the

380
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,480
representative let's say the chairman of

381
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,399
the class society

382
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,680
and then

383
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,079
are extra members for the class society

384
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,959
so there are n ways of selection of the

385
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,199
chairman out of n people

386
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,040
and then from the remaining n minus 1

387
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,040
people we need to pick out

388
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,519
so this is one way to form a class

389
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,480
society one chairman and then our other

390
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,399
members

391
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,600
now

392
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,720
we can also form a class society using a

393
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,920
different way

394
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,839
but then this is exactly doing the same

395
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,399
thing so what we are going to do here is

396
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,120
we first select all the members

397
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,880
including the chairman for the class

398
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,079
society and after that we pick the

399
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,279
chairman from these members

400
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,519
so how many ways of doing so

401
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,959
so that n choose our plus one ways to

402
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,360
select the chairman together with the

403
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,199
our members in the class society so

404
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,639
these are

405
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,720
forming the members of the class society

406
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,839
first

407
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,560
and then after that we have our plus one

408
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,680
people

409
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,600
and then we need to select the chairman

410
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,240
from from them so there are plus one

411
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,600
ways of doing so so this time we will

412
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,720
see that

413
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,560
the right hand side quantity is the

414
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,160
number of ways that we can form a class

415
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,399
society and the left-hand side is also

416
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,160
the number of ways of that we can form a

417
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
class society so they must be equal so

418
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,040
that's why they are equal again there is

419
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,000
no formula involved we are just arguing

420
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,959
things based on the rule of product here

421
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,160
rule of product here that's it

422
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,959
and now finally this is what i want to

423
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,519
introduce to you today so

424
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,160
so this is perhaps the most complicated

425
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,480
example

426
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,639
that we have

427
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,120
so this is actually a selected question

428
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,920
from

429
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,680
from our

430
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,599
exam

431
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,480
in 2019

432
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,520
so here we have a very complicated

433
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,480
summation thing

434
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,039
and then i didn't tell you

435
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,880
what this should be so you are not

436
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,559
proving this is

437
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,280
equal to what but instead

438
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,839
see if we can interpret

439
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,400
what is the summation sign here

440
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,480
so after doing the

441
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,559
the understanding of this we may be able

442
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,400
to find

443
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,360
an easy understanding of what this sum

444
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,760
could be

445
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,400
okay so this is the summation of let's

446
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,240
take a look okay so first of all this

447
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,200
time

448
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,080
bracket and i here simply means n choose

449
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,400
i so this is another shorthand notation

450
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,960
for c and i so n choose i

451
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,240
and then m minus i choose j

452
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,240
so what does that mean so first of all

453
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,480
let's take a look of this one so

454
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,000
forget about the summation let's

455
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,120
understand what this compound

456
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,360
this product means so it looks like the

457
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,799
n people that i want to pick i of them

458
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,880
and then from the remaining a minus i

459
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,039
people i want to pick j of them

460
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,000
okay so so here basically

461
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,039
we are

462
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,760
looking at something like we are trying

463
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,600
to

464
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,480
we are trying to

465
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,360
to

466
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,480
make the members the n members of people

467
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,720
into three different groups

468
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,320
so i of them

469
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,280
in the first group n choose i i of them

470
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,200
in the first group

471
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,400
right

472
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,760
and then

473
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,320
from the n minus i of them i choose j so

474
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,520
j of them in the second group

475
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,440
and finally n minus i minus j of them

476
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,679
in the third group

477
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,799
okay

478
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,280
now here for j is equal to 1 up to n

479
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,039
minus i minus 1 it means that

480
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,679
i'm selecting

481
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,280
the case that

482
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,240
j has to be at least one

483
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,200
and then j can be at most n minus i

484
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,480
minus one

485
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,440
so it means what it means that

486
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,880
the second group

487
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,200
and the third group cannot be

488
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,679
empty it must have some people inside

489
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,120
is that okay

490
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,559
now for here n minus n choose i here

491
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,080
when i ranges from 1 to n minus 2 it

492
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,320
simply means that the first group has at

493
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
least one people

494
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,120
is that okay n choose i one people

495
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,360
and up to n minus two people so that we

496
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,600
can have two people left for the second

497
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,919
group and the third group

498
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,799
so all together what does that mean

499
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,360
if you look at this summation sign

500
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,919
we sum up all the different cases

501
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,400
we are trying to

502
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,080
what we are trying to

503
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,840
to what to divide the group of n people

504
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,760
into three groups

505
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,640
okay

506
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,760
such that

507
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,200
each group is not empty

508
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,720
so how many ways of doing so

509
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,240
so any idea

510
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,600
so first of all if there are

511
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,159
no restrictions at all

512
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,960
the number of ways to divide n people

513
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,880
into three different groups

514
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,159
will be 3 to the power n

515
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,360
right

516
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,080
it is because

517
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,120
each particular person can be in group

518
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,240
one group two or group three

519
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,039
so

520
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,280
by rule of product so the first one has

521
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,039
three choice the second one has three

522
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,960
choice and so on and so forth so all

523
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,640
together they are three to the power and

524
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,600
different ways of

525
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,080
dividing the people into three groups

526
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,880
but then we want to avoid

527
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,320
people

528
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,799
so we want to avoid the case that

529
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,799
the first group is empty we want to

530
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,480
avoid the case that the second group is

531
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
empty and then we want to avoid the case

532
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,720
that the third group is empty so in that

533
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,760
case we need to do a little bit of

534
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,960
of what of corrections so 3 to the power

535
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,440
n is a little bit more than what we are

536
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,520
counting

537
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,720
so perhaps we have not done this before

538
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,240
but then we can

539
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,400
do something like the principle of

540
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,960
inclusion and exclusion that

541
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,880
i guess you have already studied in your

542
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,799
discrete math class

543
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,360
so by using the principle of inclusion

544
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,360
and exclusion

545
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,600
so the answer should not be just 3 to

546
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,799
the power n

547
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,559
it should be something like 3 to the

548
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,000
power n minus the cases where

549
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,039
one of the group is empty and then plus

550
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,159
the case where two of the groups is

551
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,520
are empty

552
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,760
and then minus the case where three of

553
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,919
the groups are all empty

554
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,120
so

555
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,600
so in that case this is my guess so you

556
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,120
can you can

557
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,799
double check whether this is correct at

558
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,840
home

559
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,799
so this is my solution okay so

560
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,600
let me write this

561
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,120
so this is my solution

562
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,520
my solution will be this one

563
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,840
is equal to

564
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,840
3 to the power n

565
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,400
minus the case that

566
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,200
exactly not exactly at least one of the

567
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,120
group is empty so let's say group 0 is

568
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,480
empty so if group 0 is empty so the the

569
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,200
the

570
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
sorry group 1 so let's say we call the

571
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,840
groups group 1 group 2 and group 3.

572
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,520
group 1 is empty so how many ways are

573
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,320
there there are two to the power m is

574
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,480
and then group 2 is empty they're 2 to

575
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,440
the power n ways root 3 is empty they're

576
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,039
2 to the power n base

577
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,400
but then we have

578
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,200
over deducted so we need to add back the

579
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,640
case where

580
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,520
group 1 is group 1 and group 2 is empty

581
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,760
so there are 1 to the power n

582
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,679
plus 1 to the power n

583
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,280
plus 1 to the power n something like

584
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,520
this so in the end this should be

585
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,559
something like so after simplification

586
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,360
this should be 3 to the power n ah maybe

587
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,480
let's see if i can use

588
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,679
a

589
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,400
how can i make it into

590
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,120
let me see format

591
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,880
one yeah i don't know how to how to

592
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,480
change it to the

593
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,080
superscript

594
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,080
there should be a symbol here let me see

595
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,600
let me see

596
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,840
and like this okay three to the power n

597
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,840
it should be something like this

598
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,320
minus 3

599
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,159
times

600
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,400
2 to the power n

601
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,200
and then finally

602
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,720
plus three

603
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,039
so

604
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,520
so this is what i would guess so

605
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,279
perhaps you can double check whether

606
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,720
this is correct or

607
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,080
so this is what i would guess

608
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,760
but to

609
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,120
yeah

610
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,279
but the way that we get this it is

611
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,400
because we have do the simplification to

612
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,799
do the understanding of what this term

613
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,120
could mean and because of this we can

614
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,440
have a good interpretation so that we

615
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,360
can use our existing knowledge to get

616
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,559
the answer

617
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,559
yeah i hope you like this so

618
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,400
combinatorial proof is very useful

619
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,120
because it avoids a lot of

620
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,880
difficult and computation so if you want

621
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,679
so

622
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,919
later we will have formulas for n choose

623
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,320
i n minus 1 minus i choose j something

624
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,640
like this but this is complicated if you

625
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,400
want to simplify them

626
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,000
not to mention that we have a lot of

627
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,240
summations here that we need to handle

628
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,559
but on the other hand if we have a way

629
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,400
to do this interpretation then

630
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,039
everything could be made easy

631
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,039
okay so i think that's all for what i

632
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,600
want to show today yeah because this is

633
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,760
the first week

634
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,799
but i want to mention one thing okay

635
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,640
so we are going to

636
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,120
assume that you will study the materials

637
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,440
of ocw recording and also the lecture

638
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,240
notes at your own pace by yourself so

639
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,559
roughly speaking

640
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,840
we will have three hour lecture normally

641
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,320
in a in a class so that's what we are

642
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,120
expecting you to to review

643
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,559
three hours of ocw recording every week

644
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,799
so on thursday

645
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,120
we will talk about a quick class summary

646
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,039
of the three hour lectures that you have

647
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:49,919
seen

648
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,480
and then on tuesday like this we will

649
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,559
answer any potential questions that you

650
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,400
want to ask us

651
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,320
or we will prepare something that is

652
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,720
interesting for you so tuesday class

653
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,880
normally will be very short

654
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,120
and that thursday class normally will be

655
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,080
very

656
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,840
quick okay but i hope if you find any

657
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,919
difficulties in the studying yeah please

658
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,240
let us know okay so meanwhile if you

659
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,200
have

660
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,360
any questions could you please

661
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,400
and

662
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,760
stand to the discussion board

663
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,400
here the chat room here

664
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,000
if not then yeah let's meet on thursday

665
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,679
and happy moon festival today

666
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,120
so because i don't see any questions so

667
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,360
let's end the class now okay thanks a

668
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,520
lot for coming okay and then and then
